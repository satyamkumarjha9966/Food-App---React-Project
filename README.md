In this repository, we present the **"Food-App"** an interactive web application that allows users to explore a wide variety of delicious food items. The main **objective of the Food-App is to provide users with an enjoyable and visually appealing platform to discover their favorite food items and filter them based on their preferences.** This project is built **using ReactJS** and **fetches data from an external API**, generously provided by another individual, ensuring a vast collection of food items for the users to explore.

The Food-App's development began by laying the groundwork for the ReactJS application. We set up the project structure and essential components required for the seamless functioning of the application. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. We focused on creating a visually appealing layout that will engage users and encourage them to explore various food items.

One of the core features of the Food-App is the ability to filter food items based on their names and food types. To accomplish this, we implemented efficient filtering functionality using React's state management. Users can easily search for specific food items by entering keywords in the search bar, and the application will dynamically display the matching results. Additionally, users can filter food items based on their preferred food types, such as breakfast, dinner, lunch, and more. This feature is implemented using dropdown menus, allowing users to quickly select their desired category and view relevant food items.

The project's data is sourced from an external API kindly provided by another developer. This API contains a vast array of food items with detailed information, including names, descriptions, images, and food types. The data is fetched and displayed dynamically, ensuring that the application stays up-to-date with the latest food items available in the API. We are incredibly grateful for this collaboration, as it significantly enriched the project's scope and allowed us to create a more comprehensive and diverse collection of food items for users to explore.

Throughout the development process, we have paid close attention to code quality and maintainability. We adhere to industry best practices and follow a modular approach to ensure that the application's codebase remains organized and scalable. This approach will not only make it easier for future contributors to understand and extend the project but also ensures the application remains robust and resilient.

In conclusion, the Food-App is a ReactJS-based web application that offers users an enjoyable experience in exploring diverse food items. Its filtering capabilities based on food names and types provide users with a personalized food discovery journey.
